My name is Apoorva Joshi and I'm currently a Security Data Scientist at Elastic. I am at my happiest when I'm working with large datasets, even better if they're unstructured (well, not really but such is life!). I have a diverse engineering background with a Bachelor's in Electrical Engineering, a Master's in Computer Engineering (focus on Data Science/ Machine Learning) and now a little over two years working as a Research Data Scientist in the Cybersecurity industry.

I started my career in Cybersecurity at FireEye, working as a Research Scientist in Email Security- Malicious URL Detection, Business Email Compromise, Phishing Campain Detection, the works. I switched gears a little bit when I moved to Elastic where I now work as a Data Scientist on the Malware Protection Team.

I am also extremely passionate about the cause of increasing the representation of women in STEM which is why outside of work, I volunteer with Girls Who Code and WiCyS (Women in Cybersecurity) to do my part in championing the cause. In the remainder of my free time, I like to paint, read, solve jigsaw puzzles, play percussion instruments and tinker with things that pique my curiosity (lately Reverse Engineering).
